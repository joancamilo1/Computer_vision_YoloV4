# YOLOv4 Darknet Object Detection Model

In the context of the mentioned computer vision project, we are employing the YOLOv4 architecture to carry out the detection and extraction of the region of interest within converted medical images. This approach involves transforming clinical data from patient records into image format, followed by the selective identification of a specific segment of interest within these images. Particularly, YOLOv4, or "You Only Look Once version 4," is distinguished by its high precision and computational efficiency in real-time object detection. It utilizes a single convolutional neural network to predict bounding box coordinates and object classification probabilities in a single pass over the input image. In our case, the implementation of YOLOv4 enables us to search through a database housing approximately 150,000 clinical images, selectively extracting the required segment for further analysis.
